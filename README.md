## **Codewars Codex** üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª  

Welcome to my **Codewars Codex**, a repository documenting my journey through the challenges on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com). This is where I hone my **JavaScript** skills, solve algorithmic puzzles and track my progress through the ranks, from beginner-friendly **8 Kyu** to master-level **Dan** challenges.

## **What Are Ranks?**

On Codewars, ranks reflect both the **difficulty of challenges** (kata) and a user's **proficiency**. They‚Äôre divided into:  

- **Kyu (8 Kyu to 1 Kyu):** Beginner to advanced levels, counting down as you progress.
- **Dan (1 Dan to 8 Dan):** Master-level challenges for more seasoned programmers, counting up.

## **Repository Structure**

This repository organises solutions by rank, following the progression from **8 Kyu** (easiest) to **1 Dan** (master-level). Currently, the repository focuses on ranks **8 Kyu** to **5 Kyu**, with plans to expand to higher levels as I progress. 

Each folder contains solutions to kata of that specific rank, named after the kata they solve.

## **About Me**

I‚Äôm a passionate coder diving deeper into JavaScript through hands-on problem-solving. My journey is about more than just learning syntax‚Äî it's about building logic, creativity, and confidence.
I find joy in unraveling challenging problems, inspired by themes of curiosity, mastery, and transcendence (much like the philosophy behind Codewars‚Äô ranks!).

## **Why This Repository?**

1. **Track My Growth:** As I refine my JavaScript skills, this repo serves as a record of my progress and achievements.  
2. **Tackle Challenges:** With each kata, I face a new puzzle, developing my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of JavaScript.  
3. **Help Others and Practice Teaching:**  I enjoy breaking down solutions into intuitive, step-by-step explanations that are easy to follow. Often, I explore multiple approaches to solving each kata to expand my understanding and provide variety.

## **Future Goals**


- **Reach 1 Dan Kata:** Reach the highest proficiency level on Codewars for JavaScript.  
- **Experiment with More Languages:** Although this repo focuses on JavaScript, I plan to expand into other programming languages in the future.
